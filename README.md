This repository contains functions for computing spin foam amplitudes for SU(2) BF theory. The algorithms here improve the computation of spin foam amplitudes via tensor contractions of low-valence tensors. 

Spin foam amplitudes are typically associated with a 2-complex which is dual to a triangulation. 

**Vertex amplitudes:** 
COherent vertex amplitudes are computed using matrix contractions. The input are 10 spins $j_{ab}$ and a set of unit normal vectors $\bf n$ for each edge.
